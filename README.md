# Hi! Welcome to my Python NumPy repsitory tutorial!
This repository is part of my Python NumPy (**Numerical Python**) tutorial.

## What is NumPy?
According to [numpy.org](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html#whatisnumpy), NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing. It is a Python library that provides multidimensional array, shape manipulation, mathematical logical, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, etc.

What's interesting is at the core of the NumPy package, which is the **ndarray** object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types (same data types), with many operation being performed in compiled code for performance.
